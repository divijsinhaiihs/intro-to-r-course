Vectors are objects that contain one or more elements. The elements of a vector should all be of the same type (mode) - numerical, logical, character, etc.

# 1

What is the sum of the first 100 integers? You may recall that the formula n(n+1)/2 gives this. Use the formula. Now, can you calculate it without using the formula? 

Hint: How do you generate a vector of numbers?

```{r}

```

# 2

Which is bigger - the sum of the first 100 odd numbers or the sum of the first 100 even numbers?

Hint: Enter ?seq at the console. If the description is confusing, you could scroll to the examples at the end of that help page.

```{r}

```
