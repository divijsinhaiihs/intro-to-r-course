## Course Outline {.smaller}

The idea is to cover a subset of R features to enable you to do data exploration

### 1. Basics, base R
> Only what is necessary for working with tabular data

### 2. Cleaning and summarising tabular data using Tidyverse
> This is a particular style, and there are alternatives

### 3. Data visualisation using ggplot
> R base plotting is the very popular alternative; we do not focus on that

### 4. Exploratory data analysis practice
> We will not get into inferential statistics

### 5. Spatial data visualisation
> Simple maps using vector data


## What we are not covering

| We are omitting some of the core parts of R as they are not necessary for the learning objective of this workshop. E.g.,

  - Arrays, Matrices
  - Base plotting
  - Lists
  - Environments
  - Object oriented programming, classes
  - Data table

## Tidy Data and Tidyverse

* In 2014, Statistician and well-known R developer Hadley Wickham introduced the philosophy of tidy data and viewing data analysis as a deeply interconnected and iterative process.
* He has also created or inspired the creation of an ecosystem of R packages related to preparation, analysis or visualisation of tidy data sets. These are collectively called the **Tidyverse**. 
* What Kind of Data is Tidy?
    * Each variable you measure should be in one column
    * Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row
    * There should be one table for each "kind" of variable
    * If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be joined or merged
